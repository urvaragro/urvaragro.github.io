                Urvaragro is an agriculture company engaging in research to make agriculture a profitable cooperative
                engagement for rural societies. The company is leveraging the vast historical data collected for years
                to analyse various variables involved in farming activity. The study involves parameters about soil
                health, complex organic and inorganic activities, climatic conditions, biodiversity and other
                agronomical factors. The company has evolved many statistical models for productive farming from
                historical data. Every product is an outcome of the holistic research conducted in the field with the
                goal of sustainable agriculture for humanity.

                In the modern world, wide seed varieties of many crops have become extinct. On the contrary, urvaragro has increased the number of varieties in its seed bank. When the world is entering the era of liberal democracies trying to ensure the right to nutrition for its citizen, Urvaragro is buckled up to pass on this multiple-seed variety with its great nutritional values to future generations.
