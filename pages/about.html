              <h2>What is Paromint? </h2>
              <p style="font-style: italic; color: #0f0f10;">
                Wisdom tells us that the whole cosmos is a singular continuous system of Non-Matter. The fastest
                particle made up of Matter takes more than four years to reach Earth from the nearest star, which is
                4.25 light-years far from Earth. Due to the physical limitations of Matter, Space exploration using
                objects made up of Matter will be a futile effort, and hence we are not into space exploration at all.
                We are in the business of providing tangible utilities available on the earth.

                Paromint is a collection of companies with one primary goal of securing and growing our shareholder’s
                capital. Therefore, our team engages in businesses which are sustainable and not speculative. We are
                working continuously to yield high ROI with caution not to compromise our social equity. We are not a
                research organisation and do not experiment with investors’ capital. Yet, we take calculated risks to
                excel in our line of business. We do not aspire to become market leaders in any sector but follow the
                middle path to achieve a significant position in our business areas. This way, we channelise our
                investments into yielding good EBIDTA. Metals, Industrial commodities, Healthcare, Energy, Digital
                Infrastructure and Agriculture, are our areas of expertise and are sectors where we are growing
                continuously. We treat our business like mountaineering and not a 100-meter race and, therefore, build
                and grow the business one mindful step at a time. Paromint is all about minding business and nothing
                else.
