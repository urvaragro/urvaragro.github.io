                End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. The Zero
                Hunger Challenge has since garnered widespread support from many member States and other entities. It
                calls for:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Zero stunted children under the age of two
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    100% access to adequate food all year round
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All food systems are sustainable
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    100% increase in smallholder productivity and income
                  </li>

                The Sustainable Development Goal to “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and
                promote sustainable agriculture” (SDG2) recognizes the inter linkages among supporting sustainable
                agriculture, empowering small farmers, promoting gender equality, ending rural poverty, ensuring healthy
                lifestyles, tackling climate change, and other issues addressed within the set of 17 Sustainable
                Development Goals in the Post-2015 Development Agenda.

                Beyond adequate calories intake, proper nutrition has other dimensions that deserve attention, including
                micronutrient availability and healthy diets. Inadequate micronutrient intake of mothers and infants can
                have long-term developmental impacts. Unhealthy diets and lifestyles are closely linked to the growing
                incidence of non-communicable diseases in both developed and developing countries.

                encouraging greater investment in skills and education, and thus providing the resources to meet
