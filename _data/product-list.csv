Nutrients,UG FerTSol,Sulphate of Potash,"The SOP is the ideal fermenter for plants with high
 nutrient demands, which satisfy the need of the 
plant, and prevent potential deficiencies, with a 
high level of Potassium and Sulphur. SOP is nitrogen-
free, allowing this product to be used according to 
the needs of many crops, but especially those where 
nitrogen should be reduced at the fruit maturation 
stage, maintaining the appropriate N:K ratio in this 
phase. SOP's low salt indices make the product 
reliable on different types of soils. SOP is the ideal 
product for fertilization programs of cultures grown 
in high-salinity soils. It is one of the most common
 sources of hydroponic potassium fertilizer.","Helps plants resist abiotic stress and enhances disease 
resistance, thereby reducing plant losses
 For manufacturing: grapes,pomegranatese, banana, cotton,

 the product ideal for crops with high Potassium 
demands. NOP contains Nitrogen in nitrate form 
which is easily assimilated by the plant. Having the 
synergistic eﬀect between NO3 - and K2O, the plants 
can achieve high rates of absorption of both elements.
 NoP is recommended to be used in any fertigation 
system and for all crops in soil or hydroponics.","In all crops when extra Potassium is needed at any 
developmental stage.
 In the crops which are sensitive to salinity.

Fertilizer,SSP,Single super phosphate,"Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient. Soil should
 be rich in phosphorus for the proper growth and
 development of crops. However, if the soil is deficient 
in Phosphorus, application of phosphorus is 
recommended to farmers. Many types of Phosphate 
fertilizers are available in the market. Among them, 
the most common and widely used fertilizer is 
Single super Phosphate(SSP).","It can be used in soil having low soil phosphorus and sulfur. 
For phosphorus use only, it costs higher than other 
phosphorus fertilizers due to its low Phosphorus 
content(16%). Single Super Phosphate is mostly preferred 
for oilseed crops as sulfur is essential to increase the 
oil content of oilseeds.",,,
Fertilizer,DAP,Di ammonia phosphate,"DAP fertilizer is an excellent source of P and nitrogen
 (N) for plant nutrition. It's highly soluble and thus
 dissolves quickly in soil to release plant-available
 phosphate and ammonium. A notable property of 
DAP is the alkaline pH that develops around 
the dissolving granule.",,,,
Fertilizer,Urea,Ammonium Nitrate and Lime,"provide the plants with nitrogen to promote green
 leafy growth and make the plants look lush.
 Urea also aids the photosynthesis process of plants. 
 Since urea fertilizer can provide only nitrogen and 
 not phosphorus or potassium, it's primarily used for 
bloom growth.",,,,
